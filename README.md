# AI for Real-Time Stock Market Analysis

This repository contains the code and resources for an AI-driven system designed for real-time stock market analysis and prediction. The project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze stock data, identify trends, and generate predictions.

## Overview

The project is structured as follows:

*   **Data Acquisition:**  Scripts for fetching real-time stock data from various sources (e.g., Yahoo Finance, IEX Cloud - *adjust based on your actual data sources*).
*   **Data Preprocessing:**  Code for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for machine learning models. This includes handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.
*   **Model Training:**  Implementation of various machine learning models for stock price prediction, such as:
    *   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) - specifically LSTMs or GRUs
    *   Time Series Models (ARIMA, Prophet)
    *   Other relevant models (*add any other models you are using*)
*   **Real-Time Prediction:**  Scripts for deploying the trained models to generate real-time stock price predictions.
*   **Backtesting and Evaluation:**  Code for evaluating the performance of the models using historical data.  Metrics include:
    *   Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    *   Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
    *   Other relevant metrics (*add any other metrics you are using*)
*   **Visualization:**  Tools for visualizing stock data, predictions, and model performance.

## Key Files

*   `#stock_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the core logic for data analysis, model training, and prediction.
*   `#stock_data.csv`: Sample stock data used for training and testing the models.  (*Note:  In a real-time system, this would be replaced by a live data feed.*)
*   `#utils.py` (or similar):  Utility functions for data preprocessing, model evaluation, and other common tasks.  (*Adjust if you have a different name for your utility file*)

## Getting Started

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file listing all the Python packages used in your project.  Example:)*

    ```
    numpy
    pandas
    scikit-learn
    tensorflow  # or pytorch, depending on your deep learning framework
    yfinance      # or other data source library
    matplotlib
    ```

3.  Run the `#stock_price_prediction.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the models.
